                Elizabeth Medina shared a personal narrative detailing their struggles during college at the University of Texas. After facing significant challenges, including strained family relationships, financial struggles, and their father’s leukemia diagnosis, they experienced isolation and guilt. Later, in an effort to cope, they encountered more difficulties: a painful resurfacing of past trauma, learning of a loved one’s mental health crisis, and facing social rejection. These events led to deep depression, causing a significant mental health decline, resulting in withdrawal and numbness. After nearly being hospitalized, they entered an intensive outpatient program (IOP) for group therapy, which became a turning point. Through this program, they connected with high-functioning adults who, despite their own struggles, were passionate and motivated, offering inspiration and a sense of belonging that greatly supported their healing journey.

                Niki Korteweg described their experience with the impact of chronic stress on brain health, highlighting how demanding work and intense pressure led to burnout. They detailed how chronic stress affects brain areas like the frontal lobe and hippocampus, impairing focus, memory, and emotional control due to increased stress hormones that damage neural connections. Despite these effects, the user shared several strategies that help counteract stress and promote brain health, including physical activity, quality sleep, a Mediterranean diet, and meditation. They explained that exercise can enhance neural growth, sleep supports cognitive function, a Mediterranean diet provides essential nutrients, and meditation improves focus and emotional resilience. By integrating these practices, they found their brain function and resilience improving, allowing them to work effectively without compromising well-being.
